### Appendix C: Extended Error Codes

{% raw %}

```none
    The extended error codes used by Interrupt 21H functions consist of
    four separate codes in the AX, BH, BL, and CH registers. These codes
    give as much detail as possible about the error and suggest how the
    issuing program should respond.


AX--Extended Error Code

    If an error condition occurs in response to an Interrupt 21H function
    call, the carry flag is set and one of the following error codes is
    returned in AX:

╓┌──────────────┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╖
    Error     Description
    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    56H       Invalid password
    57H       Invalid parameter
    58H       Network data fault


BH--Error Class

    BH returns a code that describes the class of error that occurred:

╓┌──────────────┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╖
    Class     Description
    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    01H       Out of a resource, such as storage or channels
    02H       Not an error, but a temporary situation (such as a locked
            region in a file) that can be expected to end
    03H       Authorization problem
    04H       An internal error in system software
    05H       Hardware failure
    06H       A system software failure not the fault of the active
            process (could be caused by missing or incorrect
            configuration files, for example)
    07H       Application program error
    08H       File or item not found
    09H       File or item of invalid format or type or otherwise invalid
            or unsuitable
    0AH       File or item interlocked
    0BH       Wrong disk in drive, bad spot on disk, or other problem with
            storage medium
    0CH       Other error


BL--Suggested Action

    BL returns a code that suggests how the program should respond to the
    error:

╓┌──────────────┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╖
    Action    Description
    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    01H       Retry, then prompt user.
    02H       Retry after a pause.
    03H       If the user entered data such as a drive letter or filename,
            prompt for it again.
    04H       Terminate with cleanup.
    05H       Terminate immediately. The system is so unhealthy that the
            program should exit as soon as possible without taking the
            time to close files and update indexes.
    06H       Error is informational.
    07H       Prompt the user to perform some action, such as changing
            disks, then retry the operation.


CH--Locus

    CH returns a code that provides additional information to help locate
    the area involved in the failure. This code is particularly useful for
    hardware failures (BH = 05H).

╓┌──────────────┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╖
    Locus     Description
    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    01H       Unknown
    02H       Related to random-access block devices, such as a disk drive
    03H       Related to network
    04H       Related to serial-access character devices, such as a
            printer
    05H       Related to random-access memory


Procedure

    Programs should handle errors by noting the error returned in AX from
    the original system call and then invoking Interrupt 21H Function 59H
    to get the extended error information. If no extended error
    information is provided, the program should respond to the original
    error code.

    The Function 59H system call is available during Interrupt 24H.
