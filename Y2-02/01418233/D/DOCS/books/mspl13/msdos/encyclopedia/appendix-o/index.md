### Appendix O: IBM PC ROM BIOS Calls

{% raw %}

```none
        To invoke an IBM PC ROM BIOS routine, set register AH to the desired
        function and execute the software interrupt (INT) for the desired
        routine.

        Graphics pixel coordinates and cursor row and column coordinates are
        always zero based.
