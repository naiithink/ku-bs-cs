Introduction
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

The Microsoft(R) QuickC(R) Compiler version 2.5 offers a variety of new
features that support the latest advances in C language technology. The main
enhancements in this version include language compatibility with Microsoft C
version 6.0, increased ANSI compatibility, and improvements to the user
interface.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
NOTE

The term "DOS" refers to both the MS-DOS(R) and IBM Personal Computer DOS
operating systems. The name of a specific operating system is used when it
is necessary to note features that are unique to that system.
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


Enhancements for QuickC 2.5

Here's a quick summary of the enhancements for QuickC version 2.5. The
following chapters describe these features in more detail.


    ■   Language compatibility with Microsoft C version 6.0

    ■   Increased ANSI standard C compatibility

    ■   Support for the tiny memory model

    ■   Enhanced graphics library

    ■   New Quickwatch debugging feature

    ■   Customized color window support

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
NOTE

Due to the size of the expanded run-time libraries, QuickC 2.5 must be used
with a hard disk.
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────




The QuickC Advisor has also been updated to provide information on all
QuickC language, user interface, and compiler features. Consult the Advisor
for detailed information on any of the features mentioned in this book.

Key to Document Conventions

This book uses the following document conventions:

Example                           Description
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
COPY TEST.OBJ C:                  Uppercase letters represent DOS commands
                                    and file names.

printf                            Boldface letters indicate standard
                                    features of the C language: keywords,
                                    operators, and standard library
                                    functions.

expression                        Words in italics indicate placeholders
                                    for information you must supply, such as
                                    a file name. Italics are also
                                    occasionally used for emphasis in the
                                    text.

main()                            This typeface is used for example
{                                 programs, program fragments, and the
}                                 names of user-defined functions and
                                    variables. It also indicates user input
                                    and screen output.

CL options «files...»             A horizontal ellipsis following an item
                                    indicates that more items having the
                                    same form may follow.

while( )                          A vertical ellipsis tells you that part
{                                 of the example program has been
    .                              intentionally omitted.
    .
    .
}

SHIFT                             Small capital letters denote names of
                                    keys on the keyboard. A plus sign ( + )
                                    indicates a combination of keys. For
                                    example, SHIFT+F5 tells you to hold down
                                    the SHIFT key while pressing the F5 key.

"array pointer"                   The first time a new term is defined, it
                                    is enclosed in quotation marks. Since
                                    some knowledge of programming is assumed,
                                    common terms such as memory or branch
                                    are not defined.

American National Standards       The first time an acronym appears, it is
Institute (ANSI)                  spelled out.






Chapter 1  User Interface Changes
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

The changes in version 2.5 of the QuickC Compiler environment implement new
features, such as the Quickwatch command, as well as improvements to
existing features. This chapter describes the changes; they are grouped
according to the menu in which they appear.

Remember, you can use online help to get information about all environment
features, including those described in this section.


1.1  File Menu Changes

The following changes are found in the File menu:

Change                            Description
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Read-only file warning            If you select a read-only file with the
                                    Open command in the File menu, a dialog
                                    box informs you the file is read-only.

Closing notepad files             In QuickC 2.5, closing the Notepad
                                    window saves and frees the file. In
                                    QuickC 2.0, when you load a file in the
                                    Notepad window and then close it, the
                                    file is not freed. The file therefore
                                    cannot be loaded into the Program
                                    window.


1.2  View Menu Changes

The following change is found in the View menu:

Change                            Description
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Registers window                  The Registers window displayed with the
                                    Windows command in the View menu has
                                    been modified to display information
                                    about the math coprocessor chip and
                                    emulator. Additionally, pressing TAB
                                    moves the cursor forward between
                                    modifiable fields, while pressing
                                    SHIFT+TAB moves the cursor backward
                                    between modifiable fields. Pressing
                                    ENTER or double-clicking the Left mouse
                                    button allows you to modify a register.


1.3  Search Menu Changes

The following changes are found in the Search menu:

Change                            Description
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
New Go to command                 The Go to... command has been added to
                                    the Search menu. This command displays a
                                    dialog box into which you type a desired
                                    line number. Then QuickC moves the
                                    cursor to that line.

Selected text shortcut key        Since the backslash key ( \ ) is not
                                    available on standard European keyboards,
                                    the shortcut key for the Selected Text
                                    command has been changed from CTRL+\ to
                                    CTRL+F3. CTRL+\ is now the shortcut key
                                    for the Find command in the Search menu.
                                    The effect of CTRL+\ can be modified
                                    with the MKKEY utility.




1.4  Make Menu Changes

The following changes are found in the Make menu:

Change                            Description
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Canceling the build process       With version 2.5, pressing ESC cancels a
                                    compile, but not a link. The dialog box
                                    tells you to press CTRL+BREAK to cancel
                                    both compiling and linking. Previously,
                                    when either the Build or the Rebuild All
                                    command was given, the dialog box said
                                    to press ESC to cancel compiling and
                                    linking.

.H files in the program list      QuickC 2.5 supports adding .H files to
                                    the program list with the Edit Program
                                    List command. QuickC treats all .C files
                                    as dependents of the .H files in the
                                    list. If an include file is modified,
                                    QuickC performs a full rebuild. If you
                                    have hand-edited a makefile to encode .H
                                    file dependencies, then QuickC does not
                                    display these include files as part of
                                    the program list in the Edit Program
                                    List dialog box. If QuickC rewrites the
                                    hand-edited makefile, these include-file
                                    dependencies are not modified.

Alphabetical file                 File names are now displayed
display in the                    alphabetically in the program list and
program list                      in the dialog box displayed by choosing
                                    the Source command in the View menu.
                                    Consequently, names of .LIB files are
                                    displayed at the end of the list,
                                    eliminating the need to scroll over
                                    names of files that cannot be opened
                                    with the Source command.


1.5  Debug Menu: New Quickwatch Command

The Quickwatch command is a new feature in QuickC 2.5. It gives you a faster
view of variables and expressions than does the Watch Value command. To use
Quickwatch


    1.  Move the cursor to the variable you want to watch, or highlight the
        expression you want to watch.

    2.  Choose the Quickwatch command from the Debug menu or press SHIFT+F9


QuickC displays a dialog box with the selected variable or expression along
with the current value. See Figure 1.1.

(This figure may be found in the printed book.)

Instead of placing the cursor on the variable or highlighting the expression
you want to watch, you can select Quickwatch, or press SHIFT+F9, and type an
expression in the text box of the dialog box.

The lower part of the Quickwatch dialog box contains the following buttons:


Zoom Modify Value Evaluate Cancel Add Watch Help

The Zoom button expands or contracts an array or structure. Zoom displays
the values of the array members or structure elements in the List box. To
show levels of expansion in the List box, nested elements are indented one
space. If the expression has already been expanded, the Zoom button
contracts the items. If a variable can be expanded, it has a "+" prefix. If
a variable can be contracted, it has a "-" prefix. If the expression cannot
be expanded or contracted and Zoom is selected, QuickC beeps.

The Evaluate button uses the current expression in the Expression text box
as the new base variable. If the expression can be expanded, the Zoom button
displays items in the List box.

To further expand nested items shown in the List box, select item names with
the mouse or cursor. The item names are copied to the Expression text box,
and the appropriate values are displayed in the Value text box and the List
box. Then you can use the Zoom button to expand or contract the nested
items.

The Add Watch button adds the current expression to the Watch window. If the
expression is already included in the Watch window, Add Watch has no effect.


The Modify Value button changes the value of the expression to the value
entered in the Value text box. When you select Modify Value, QuickC records
and displays the updated value in the List box.

The Cancel button closes the Quickwatch dialog box.

The Help button displays information about using the Quickwatch dialog box.



1.6  Options Menu Changes

The following changes are found in the Options menu:

Change                            Description
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Run/Debug command-line length     In QuickC 2.5, the Command Line text box
limitation                        in the Run/Debug dialog box accepts up
                                    to 126 characters. A warning message is
                                    displayed if the length of text exceeds
                                    126 characters. QuickC 2.0 accepts up to
                                    256 characters. However, only the first
                                    126 characters are used.

Compiler flags, linker flags,     Numerous changes have been made to the
and display dialog box changes    compiler flags, linker flags, and
                                    display dialog boxes. They are described
                                    in the following sections.

New color command                 Enhanced options for setting colors in
                                    QuickC are described below.


1.6.1  Compiler Flags Dialog-Box Changes

The Compiler Flags dialog box, shown in Figure 1.2, contains the following
modifications:


    ■   The Compiler Flags dialog box, displayed by selecting the Compiler
        Flags button in the Make dialog box, has been modified to support the
        tiny memory model.

    ■   The Warning Level option has been changed from a set of option buttons
        to a text box, and this option now supports warning levels up to 4. If
        you enter an invalid warning level, QuickC displays a warning message.

    ■   In QuickC version 2.5, the Full CodeView check box replaces the Line
        Numbers Only option under Debug Flags in version 2.0. If Full CodeView
        is checked, QuickC generates complete information on the Microsoft
        CodeView(R) debugger. If the option is left unchecked, QuickC
        generates line number information.

    ■   Three Custom Flags text boxes have been added to the dialog box. They
        allow you to specify additional Global, Debug, and Release compiler
        directives.

        (This figure may be found in the printed book.)



1.6.2  Linker Flags Dialog-Box Changes

The Linker Flags dialog box, shown in Figure 1.3, contains the following
changes:


    ■   The Global Flags check boxes contain a new option called Generate .COM
        File. This option uses the tiny memory model to create .COM files.

    ■   A new Memory Needs text box allows you to specify the amount of memory
        to allocate for a program.

    ■   The new Custom Flags text box allows you to specify additional Global
        linker directives, as well as those for Debug and Release versions of
        the program. Enter linker directives in the appropriate text box.

        (This figure may be found in the printed book.)



1.6.3  Display Dialog-Box Changes

The Display dialog box, shown in Figure 1.4, has been changed as follows:


    ■   The Save Before Build check box controls whether files are saved
        before building.

    ■   The Keep Tabs option controls tab settings. If the option is off, tabs
        are converted to the appropriate number of spaces. Then when the file
        is saved, leading spaces are converted back to tabs. If the option is
        on, tabs are always treated as tabs and are never converted to spaces.
        The default for this option is off, which is equivalent to the QuickC
        2.0 method of handling tabs.

    ■   The Show 8087 check box controls whether the 8087 registers are
        displayed in the Registers window.

    ■   When you check the Save Before Build check box, QuickC saves any
        changes in open files before it builds the program.


(This figure may be found in the printed book.)

The Display dialog box no longer contains a color selection option. Expanded
color options are now available through the Color command in the Options
menu.


1.6.4  New Color Command

The Color command in the Options menu gives you greater control over the
appearance of QuickC. Items such as menus, borders, buttons, and text within
windows (such as source, errors, and registers) can all be given unique
colors (see Figure 1.5).

(This figure may be found in the printed book.)

Four predefined color sets are available. All four color sets can be
modified.

Color Set                         Description
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1                                 Defines the color set for 16-color
                                    display monitors

2                                 Defines the color set for 8-color
                                    displays

3                                 Specifies the color set for monochrome
                                    displays

LCD                               Defines the color set for Liquid Crystal
                                    Displays

You can customize the color of a window item by selecting that item from the
Item list box, then changing the values in the Foreground and Background
list boxes. Changing an item's color modifies it only within the selected
color set.

The Redraw button redraws the screen with the new color values. Color
changes take place when the OK button is pressed.

The Default button restores the normal color values. The default colors for
each set are shown in the following list:

Color Set                         Default
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1                                 QuickC 2.0 #1

2                                 QuickBasic 4.5 8-color

3                                 QuickC 2.0 #3

LCD                               QuickC 2.0 LCD


1.7  Help Menu Changes

The following changes are found in the Help menu:


    ■   In QuickC 2.5, if a low memory condition exists when you try to access
        online help, a dialog box appears and asks if you want to close the
        current program first, thus freeing enough memory to run help.

    ■   In QuickC 2.0, if there isn't enough memory to access online help,
        QuickC displays an  Out of Memory  error. At this point, the only way
        to get help information is to exit QuickC and start over again.







Chapter 2  Language Differences
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

This chapter describes the language differences between versions 2.5 and 2.0
of the QuickC Compiler. Some of the changes are required by the American
National Standards Institute (ANSI) standard for the C programming language.
Other changes improve or augment the existing capabilities of QuickC and
make it compatible with Microsoft C version 6.0.

The chapter is divided into four sections:


    ■   ANSI Compatibility

    ■   New Language Keywords

    ■   New Language Features

    ■   Changes and Deletions


Many of the changes described in this chapter do not affect code written for
previous versions of QuickC. In some cases, however, you may have to modify
existing code before compiling with version 2.5. Refer to section 2.4,
"Changes and Deletions," for revisions that may impact your program.


2.1  ANSI Compatibility

A number of changes have been made to the compiler to support the ANSI
stan-dard. These include additions that make QuickC programs more portable
and allow you to take advantage of more ANSI features.


2.1.1  ANSI-Mandated New Features

The following ANSI-mandated features are new to QuickC 2.5:


    ■   Both long and unsigned long values are allowed in switch expressions
        and case constants. Previous versions of QuickC allow only char and
        int values in this context.

    ■   QuickC supports unsigned long decimal constants. It is now possible to
        initialize unsigned long variables with values larger than MAX_LONG
        using decimal (rather than hexadecimal or octal) constants.

    ■   You can declare signed as well as unsigned bitfields.

    ■   Bitfields are permitted in unions.

    ■   Storage classes or types (or both) are now required on variable
        declarations. QuickC previously assumed that declarations without a
        specific type were integer declarations. An untyped declaration now
        generates a warning.

    ■   The LOCALE.H header file is new to version 2.5. It declares functions
        and structures for describing conventions, such as the currency
        symbol, that vary from one country to another.

    ■   The semantics for volatile have been implemented. Previously, volatile
        was only syntactically implemented.



2.1.2  Integer Promotion Rules

The ANSI standard changes the method of evaluation of some expressions that
mix signed and unsigned integers. Earlier versions of QuickC attempt to
preserve an expression's unsigned nature as much as possible. Version 2.5
attempts to preserve the expression's value.

In version 2.5, an unsigned char promotes to a signed int; an unsigned int
promotes to a signed long.

In version 2.0, an unsigned char promotes to an unsigned int; an unsigned
int promotes to an unsigned long.

For example:

    main()
    {
    long int li = -256L;
    test( li );
    }

    test( long li )
    {
    if( li < 0xffff )
        puts( "QuickC 2.5 does a signed comparison" );
        else puts( "QuickC 2.0 does an unsigned comparison" );
    }


2.1.3  Defining NULL as a Pointer

The constant NULL is now defined as  ((void *)0). Previous versions of
QuickC define NULL as 0x0000 in the small and medium models and as
0x00000000L in the compact and large models.


2.1.4  Shift Operators

Shift operators now give a result that is of the same type as the left
operand. For example, consider the code fragment

    short short_int;
    long long_int;
    short_int = 0x0001;
    long_int = short_int << 16L;

To adhere to the ANSI standard, QuickC 2.5 maintains the size of the left
operand. The variable  short_int  has 16 bits. Shifting left 16 times
produces a value of 0, which is then assigned to  long_int.

QuickC previously yielded a result that was the size of the "widest" (or
largest) of the two values. In the example above, the short value is
automatically cast to a long because 16L is long. The value assigned to
long_int  is 0x00010000L in QuickC 2.0.


2.1.5  Pointers to Type Definitions

The rules for handling pointers to type definitions have changed subtly. For
example, QuickC 2.5 interprets

    typedef int far f_int;
    f_int *fp_i;

as being equivalent to

    int far *fp_i;

which means  fp_i  is a near variable that is a far pointer to an integer.
The address of the integer contains 32 bits. The size of the address of
fp_i  is memory model dependent.

QuickC 2.0 interprets the declaration as

    int *far fp_i;

where  fp_i  is a far variable that is a near pointer to an integer. The
address of  fp_i  is 32 bits. The size of the integer's address is
indeterminate.

This change in handling pointers to type definitions affects type
definitions containing _near, _far, _based, and other modifiers. Although
these are Microsoft-specific keywords, their new behavior is consistent with
the ANSI standard's requirements for the const and volatile keywords.


2.1.6  Identifying Nonstandard Keywords

The following modifiers are specific to QuickC; they are not part of the
ANSI standard. To identify these implementation-defined keywords as
non-ANSI, an initial underscore has been added.

QuickC 2.5 Keyword                QuickC 2.0 Keyword
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
_far                              far

_huge                             huge

_near                             near

_cdecl                            cdecl

_fortran                          fortran

_interrupt                        interrupt

_pascal                           pascal

The compiler still accepts the obsolescent versions of these keywords,
unless you use the /Za (disable extensions) option.


2.1.7  Trigraphs

To maintain ANSI compatibility with and portability to other systems, QuickC
supports the trigraphs listed below. The compiler interprets each sequence
in the left column as equivalent to the character shown in the right column.


Trigraph                          Character
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
??=                               #

??(                               [

??/                               \

??)                               ]

??'                               ^

??<                               {

??!                               |

??>                               }

??-                               ~


2.1.8  ANSI Nonconformance

Areas in which QuickC version 2.5 does not follow the ANSI standard include
the following:


    ■   QuickC does not support multibyte characters, wide-character constants
        and string constants comprising wide characters, and the related
        library functions and types.

    ■   QuickC contains some extended keywords (such as _near and _far),
        non-ANSI macros and types in header files, and extended library
        function names (such as read and write) that exceed ANSI name-space
        maximums.



2.2  New Language Keywords

This section describes keywords that do not exist in previous versions of
QuickC. Details about the use of these keywords can be found in the online
help.


2.2.1  In-Line Assembler

A new pseudoinstruction, _emit, has been added for use with the in-line
assembler. This pseudoinstruction allows you to define a single immediate
byte at the current location in the current text segment.


2.2.2  Based Pointers and Objects

QuickC 2.5 supports the following new keywords and operators: _based,
_segment, _segname, and :>. They are used to declare and manipulate based
objects.

Based object support is included in QuickC 2.5 for the sake of compatibility
with Microsoft C version 6.0. Refer to Chapter 2, "Managing Memory," in
Microsoft C Advanced Programming Techniques for further details.


2.2.3  Long Double Types

Because the 80x87 family of math coprocessors supports an 80-bit
floating-point type, QuickC version 2.5 stores long double variables in the
80x87 10-byte (80-bit) form.

QuickC version 2.0 recognizes long double and double as different types,
with both types stored in memory as 64-bit quantities.

Certain library functions have been modified to handle the long double type.
The printf and scanf family of functions supports long double values; their
format has the l type prefix. The library contains new versions of the
transcendental functions as well as intrinsic forms that accept long double
arguments. The names of these functions have a trailing l (for example,
cosl).


2.2.4  The _fastcall Function Attribute (/Gr Option)

The new _fastcall function attribute enables QuickC to pass function
arguments in processor registers instead of on the stack. This ability
results in faster function calls when a QuickC program is built with
Microsoft C version 6.0.

You can define fastcall functions in two ways. Use the _fastcall function
attribute to declare an individual function as fastcall:

    int _fastcall FastFunc( void );

Additionally, the /Gr option enables the fastcall function-calling
convention for all functions that are not explicitly prototyped with the
_cdecl, _pascal, or _fortran attributes. Using /Gr on the command line
causes each function in the module to compile as _fastcall unless the
function is declared with a conflicting attribute, or the name of the
function is main.

None of the library functions have the fastcall attribute; their arguments
are passed on the stack, not in registers. If you compile with the /Gr
option, you must include the correct header file for each library function
or write a prototype for the function using the _cdecl attribute.

A fastcall function can receive up to three 16-bit arguments. Arguments are
passed in the AX, BX, and DX registers. Fastcall arguments are passed in the
registers shown below. If you pass one character argument, it is passed in
the AL register. If you pass two character arguments, the second argument is
passed in DL, and so on.

Argument Type                     Registers
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Character                         AL, DL, BL

Short integer                     AX, DX, BX

Near pointer                      BX, AX, DX

Long integer                      DX:AX

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
WARNING

Future versions of QuickC may pass fastcall arguments in different
registers.
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

If all of the registers for a particular type have already been used, or if
an argument is not one of the types listed above, it is pushed on the stack
as usual. Given an argument list of types long, float, and short, QuickC
passes the long in DX:AX, pushes the float, and passes the short in BX.
Fastcall functions return any floating-point value on the floating-point
processor stack.

The treatment of character arguments is also dependent on prototypes. If
there is no prototype, the argument is promoted to short.

The _fastcall convention is not compatible with any of the following
attributes: _interrupt, _saveregs, _export, _cdecl, _fortran, or _pascal.
Consult online help for more information on these attributes.


2.3  New Language Features

A number of new language features have been implemented in version 2.5 to
maintain compatibility with Microsoft C version 6.0.


2.3.1  Strings and Macros

QuickC now allows longer string literals (up to 2K) and longer macro
expansions (up to 12K). In low memory conditions, the macro expansion space
could be limited to 6K.


2.3.2  Tiny Memory Model (.COM Files)

QuickC 2.5 supports the tiny memory model, which produces .COM files rather
than .EXE files. In the tiny memory model, all of your program code and data
must fit in a single 64K segment.

The /AT option selects the tiny model. This option causes the linker to use
the /NOE and /TINY options. Within the linker, /TINY turns on the
/FARCALLTRANSLATION option to help eliminate far-segment relocations. If you
invoke QLINK separately on your own .OBJ files, link with the CRTCOM library
and make it first in the .OBJ list. The /TINY option is incompatible with
the /INCREMENTAL option.


2.3.3  Custom Memory Models

For most programs, using one of the standard memory models is sufficient. In
special cases, however, you may need to create a customized memory model.
For example, you might want to create a huge-compact model that would allow
huge data items but only one code segment.

You can create a custom memory model with the /A compiler option. /A must be
followed by three letters representing the following memory-model
attributes:


    ■   Code pointer size

    ■   Data pointer size

    ■   Stack- and data-segment setup


Table 2.1 shows the options used for defining code pointers, data pointers,
and stack- and data-segment setup in custom memory models.

Table   2.1 Custom Memory Model Options

╓┌─────────────────────────────────┌───────┌─────────────────────────────────╖
Attribute                         Option  Meaning

Code Addresses                    s       Near (16-bit)

                                    l       Far (32-bit)

Data Pointers                     n       Near (6-bit)

                                    f       Far (32-bit)

                                    h       Huge (32-bit normalized)

Stack-and Data-Segment Setup      d       Assume SS==DS (default)

                                    u       Assume SS!=DS; DS is reloaded on
                                            function entry.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
                                            function entry.

                                    w       Assume SS!=DS; DS is not
                                            reloaded on function entry.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────



You must specify all three options, but the letters can follow /A in any
order. To specify the huge-compact model mentioned earlier, for example, you
can use /Ashd, /Ahsd, or some other ordering of the following letters: s
(for near code addresses), h (for huge data pointers), and d (for the
default data- and stacksegment setup).

The easiest way to customize a memory model is to use a standard memory
model and modify the stack-setup option. A stack- and data-segment option
from Table 2.1 overrides the corresponding part of the standard memory-model
configuration; Table 2.2 shows the standard models' equivalents. Since /AS
is the equivalent of /Asnd, then /ASw is the equivalent of /Asnw.

2.3.4  Omitting Names of Nested Structures and Unions

If a structure or union is nested inside another structure or union, you can
declare the inner one without using a variable name. This rule allows you to
access inner members of such nested constructs using fewer variable names.
The following example demonstrates this technique using nested structures:

    #include.h

    void main( void )
    {
    struct ours
    {
    int mine, yours;
    };

    struct mystruct
    {
    float bobber;
    struct ours;
    char name[9];
    } sample;

    sample.yours = 100;
    printf( "sample.yours: %i\n", sample.yours );
    }

The example declares two structure types. The first structure type, named
ours, contains two int members. The second, named  mystruct, contains three
members, one of which is a structure of type  ours.

The second structure type declares its structure member using only the
structure tag  ours. It does not supply a variable name after the tag:

    struct ours;

Thus, subsequent parts of the program can access members of the nested
structure without specifying a name:

    sample.yours = 100;

In contrast, if the nested structure had been declared using a variable
name, as in

    struct ours var_name;

subsequent statements would have to use that name as well:

    sample.var_name.yours = 100;

As you can see, declaring the nested structure without a variable name saves
some typing. The same rule applies to unions nested inside structures.


2.3.5  Unsized Arrays as the Last Member of a Structure

QuickC now allows an unsized or zero-sized array as the last member of a
structure. The declaration of such a structure would look like this:

    struct var_length
    {
        <set of declarations>;
        <type> array[];
    };

Unsized arrays can appear only as the last member of a structure. Structures
containing unsized array declarations can be nested within other structures
as long as no further members are declared in any enclosing structures.
Arrays of such structures are not allowed.

When you apply the sizeof operator to a variable of this type, or to the
type itself, QuickC assumes the array has the size zero.


2.3.6  Improved Warnings

QuickC version 2.5 supports a new warning level (4), which provides even
more stringent error checking than the warning levels in version 2.0. You
can set this warning level from the command line by supplying the /W4
compiler option, or from the QuickC environment with the Compiler Flags
dialog box shown with the Make command on the Options menu.

At warning level 4, QuickC can generate the following new warnings:


    ■   Nonportable (non-ANSI) constructs

    ■   Undefined or implementation-defined constructs


Consult online help for more information about these warnings.


2.3.7  Macros

The number of macros definable with /D options in QuickC has increased from
20 to 30.


2.4  Changes and Deletions

This section describes QuickC 2.0 features that are changed or deleted in
QuickC 2.5. Note that these changes may affect existing programs.


2.4.1  Deleted Features

The data_seg pragma has been deleted.

The memory management routine sbrk has been deleted.


2.4.2  Conditional Compilation and Signed Values

Version 2.0 of QuickC treats conditional-compilation expressions as signed
long values. Version 2.5 evaluates these expressions using the same rules as
expressions in C. For example, the expression

    #if 0xFFFFFFFFL > 1UL
    .
    .
    .
    #endif

evaluates as true. It is evaluated as false in version 2.0, since the signed
value would be less than the unsigned value.


2.4.3  The const and volatile Qualifiers

The const and volatile qualifiers must be placed after the type they
qualify. The declaration

    int (const *p);

is now treated as a syntax error. Previous versions of QuickC accept this
construction.

The following declarations are legal:

    int const *p_ci;  /* pointer to constant int */
    int const (*p_ci); /* pointer to constant int */
    int *const cp_i;  /* constant pointer to int */
    int (*const cp_i); /* constant pointer to int */

Consult online help for more information about const and volatile.


2.4.4  Memory Allocation

The _fmalloc function attempts to allocate far memory. In version 2.5,
_fmalloc returns a null pointer if far memory isn't available, even if near
memory is available. In previous versions of QuickC, _fmalloc calls _nmalloc
if far memory is not available.


2.4.5  Memory Used by Command-Line Arguments

In QuickC 2.5, the command-line argument strings are allocated through
malloc, which means they are in far memory in the compact and large memory
models. Previous versions of QuickC place the command-line argument strings
and environment strings in the near heap.


2.4.6  Format Specifiers in printf and scanf

The printf format specifier modifiers N, F, h, and l have changed. These
specifiers are documented in online help.

The specifier %Np is a synonym for %hp, but the latter is preferred.
Likewise, %Fp is a synonym for %lp.

For scanf, the modifiers N and F refer to the distance to the object being
read in; that is, whether the pointer itself is allocated near or far. The
modifiers h and l refer to the size of the object (16-bit near pointer or
32-bit far pointer). In these examples,

    scanf("%Nlp", n_fp);
    scanf("%Fhp", f_np);

the first line reads an address that resides in near memory (N) but holds a
32-bit far pointer variable (lp). The second line reads a near pointer value
(hp) into a pointer variable that resides in far memory (F).


2.4.7  Functions that Return Float Values

In QuickC 2.5, a prototype or definition such as

    float funcname();

is interpreted as

    float funcname()

so the function returns a float value.

Whereas version 2.0 interprets it as

    double funcname()

returning a double value.


2.4.8  The char Variable Alignment

QuickC 2.5 does not align char variables on even addresses unless a variable
is local. Similarly, literal constant strings are not aligned as they are in
QuickC version 2.0






Chapter 3  Compiler, Linker, and Utility Changes
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

The QuickC Compiler version 2.5 supports a variety of new compiler, linker,
and utility options. Most of these options provide compatibility with
Microsoft C version 6.0. Since QuickC can be used as a prototyping
environment for programs that will ultimately be compiled with Microsoft C,
the compiler supports the development of programs that run under non-DOS
operating systems. Refer to the Microsoft C version 6.0 documentation for
additional information.

This chapter is divided into sections alphabetically listing compiler,
linker, and utility changes. For detailed information on the options,
consult the online help.


3.1  Compiler Options

The following compiler options are new to QuickC 2.5:

Option                            Instruction
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
/Axxx                             Use custom memory model. The xxx is a
                                    three-letter representation of the
                                    memory-model attributes: code pointer
                                    size, data pointer size, and stack and
                                    data segment setup. You must use all
                                    three letters (in any order) following
                                    /A. See Chapter 2, "Language
                                    Differences," for additional information.

/AT                               Use tiny memory model. This option
                                    creates a program with the .COM
                                    extension. The program has a single 64K
                                    segment for both code and data.

/G1                               Use 80186 instructions.

/Gd                               Use the _cdecl calling convention for
                                    all functions in the module. See Chapter
                                    2, "Language Differences," for more
                                    information.

/Ge                               Generate calls to the stack-checking
                                    routine.

/Gr                               Use the _fastcall calling convention for
                                    functions not explicitly given the
                                    _cdecl, _pascal, or _fortran attribute.
                                    See Chapter 2, "Language Differences,"
                                    for additional information.

/NDdata_segment_name              Name the data segment of a
                                    data_segment_name module. This option is
                                    commonly used to create and compile
                                    modules that contain only data.

/nologo                           Suppress the startup banner display.

/Vstring                          Embed string, which specifies a version
                                    number, in the object file.

/Wx                               Use warning level x, where x is from 0
                                    to 4.

Chapter 4  Library Changes
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

The QuickC Compiler version 2.5 incorporates over 100 new library routines
to maintain compatibility with Microsoft C version 6.0. This chapter lists
and briefly summarizes the new library routines by category. For a complete
description of each routine, refer to online help.


4.1  Buffer-Manipulation Routines

Routines preceded by the _f prefix are model-independent versions. The _f
prefix indicates that these routines operate with far pointers.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
NOTE

The buffer-manipulation routines assume that the direction flag is cleared.
If you are using other functions with the buffer-manipulation functions, you
must ensure that the other functions leave the direction flag alone or
restore it to its original condition.
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

NOTE

The string-manipulation routines assume that the direction flag is cleared.
If you are using other functions with the string-manipulation routines, you
must ensure that the other routines leave the direction flag alone or
restore it to its original condition.

Chapter 5  Error-Message Reference
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

This chapter lists error messages that are new with the QuickC Compiler
version 2.5. Error messages common to versions 2.0 and 2.5 are documented in
the  Microsoft QuickC Tool Kit.


5.1  Compiler Errors

The error messages produced by the C compiler fall into three categories:


    1.  Fatal-error messages

    2.  Compilation-error messages

    3.  Warning messages


New error messages for each category are listed below in numerical order,
with a brief explanation of each error.


5.1.1  Fatal-Error Messages

Fatal-error messages indicate a severe problem, one that prevents the
compiler from processing your program any further. These messages have the
following format:

filename(line) : fatal error C1xxx: messagetext

After the compiler displays a fatal-error message, it terminates without
producing an object file or checking for further errors.

Number                            Fatal-Error Message
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
C1005                             string too big for buffer

                                    A string in a compiler intermediate file
                                    overflowed a buffer.

C1006                             write error on compiler intermediate
                                    file

                                    The compiler was unable to create the
                                    intermediate files used in the
                                    compilation process.

C1011                             compiler limit : 'identifier' : macro
                                    definition too big

                                    The macro definition was longer than
                                    allowed.

                                    Split the definition into shorter
                                    definitions.

C1023                             cannot open source file 'filename'

                                    The given file either did not exist,
                                    could not be opened, or was not found.

                                    Make sure the environment settings are
                                    valid and that the correct path name for
                                    the file is specified.

                                    If this error appears without an error
                                    message, the compiler has run out of
                                    file handles. If in DOS, increase the
                                    number of file handles by changing the
                                    FILES setting CONFIG.SYS to allow a
                                    larger number of open files. FILES=20 is
                                    the recommended setting.

C1024                             cannot open include file 'filename'

                                    The specified file in an #include
                                    preprocessor directive could not be
                                    found.

                                    Make sure settings for the INCLUDE and
                                    TMP environment variables are valid and
                                    that the correct path name for the file
                                    is specified.

                                    If this error appears without an error
                                    message, the compiler has run out of
                                    file handles. If in DOS, increase the
                                    number of file handles by changing the
                                    FILES setting in CONFIG.SYS to allow a
                                    larger number of open files. FILES=20 is
                                    the recommended setting.

C1025                             compiler terminated by user

                                    The compiler was stopped by the user.

C1026                             parser stack overflow, please simplify
                                    your program

                                    The program cannot be processed because
                                    the space required to parse the program
                                    causes a stack overflow in the compiler.

                                    Simplify the program by decreasing the
                                    complexity of expressions. Decrease the
                                    level of nesting in for and switch
                                    statements by putting some of the more
                                    deeply nested statements in separate
                                    functions. Break up very long
                                    expressions involving ',' operators or
                                    function calls.

C1027                             DGROUP data allocation exceeds 64K

                                    More than 64K of variables were
                                    allocated to the default data segment.

                                    For compact-, large-, or huge-model
                                    programs, compile with the QCL command
                                    and use the /Gt option to move items
                                    into separate segments. In small- or
                                    medium-model programs, consider
                                    explicitly allocating some variables
                                    outside of DGROUP by using _based or
                                    _far.

                                    The compiler detected an unexpected
                                    end-of-file condition while creating a
                                    source listing or mingled source/object

C1042                             cannot open compiler intermediate file -
                                    no such file or directory

                                    The compiler could not create
                                    intermediate files for use in the
                                    compilation process because the TMP
                                    environment variable was set to an
                                    invalid directory or path.

C1043                             cannot open compiler intermediate file

                                    could not be determined.

                                    One of the following may be a solution:

C1050                             'segment' : code segment too large

                                    A code segment grew to within 36 bytes
                                    of 64K during compilation.

                                    A 36-byte pad is used because of a bug
                                    in some 80286 chips that can cause
                                    programs to exhibit strange behavior
                                    when, among other conditions, the size
                                    of a code segment is within 36 bytes of
                                    64K.

C1057                             unexpected end-of-file in macro

                                    The compiler has encountered the end of
                                    the source file while gathering the
                                    arguments of a macro invocation. Usually
                                    this is the result of a missing closing
                                    parenthesis, ), on the macro invocation.

C1064                             compiler limit : token overflowed
                                    internal buffer

                                    The compiler read an identifier that is
                                    longer than the internal buffer used for
                                    identifier names.

                                    Shorten the name and recompile.

C1071                             unexpected end-of-file found in comment

                                    The compiler found the end of a file
                                    while scanning a comment.

                                    Probably a comment was not terminated.
                                    Begin at the end of the file and search
                                    backward for the beginning of a comment.
                                    A comment begins with "/*" and ends with
                                    "*/" as in:

                                    /* This is a comment */

                                    A comment may not be split across files.

C1072                             'filename' : cannot read file

                                    The compiler encountered an error when
                                    trying to read a file.

                                    Check the file-access attributes and be
                                    sure the disk does not have a bad sector.

C1090                             'segment' data allocation exceeds 64K

                                    The size of the named segment exceeds
                                    64K.

                                    This error occurs with _based allocation.

C1127                             'segment': segment redefinition

                                    A segment was overwritten by another
                                    with the same name.

                                    For example, compiling in large model
                                    with

                                    #pragma alloc_text("TEXT", func1)

                                    creates two segments: the default
                                    segment "module_TEXT" and the specified
                                    segment "_TEXT". However, in small model,
                                    the default segment is "_TEXT", and the
                                    specified segment "_TEXT" will overwrite
                                    the default segment.


5.1.2  Compilation-Error Messages

The messages listed below indicate that your program has errors. They appear
in the following format:

filename(line) : error C2xxx: messagetext

When the compiler encounters any of the errors listed in this section, it
continues parsing the program (if possible) and outputs additional error
messages. However, no object file is produced.

                                    The given identifier referred to a
                                    structure or union type that was not
                                    defined.

                                    The given character was not a legal
                                    digit for the base used.

C2080                             illegal far _fastcall function

                                    A far _fastcall function may not be
                                    compiled with the /Gw option, or with
                                    the /GW option, if stack checking is
                                    enabled.

C2121                             'operator' : bad left/right operand

                                    The left or right operand of the given
                                    operator was illegal for that operator.

C2124                             divide or mod by zero

                                    A constant expression was evaluated and
                                    found to have a zero denominator.

C2128                             'identifier' : huge array cannot be
                                    aligned to segment boundary

                                    The given huge array was large enough to
                                    cross two segment boundaries, but could
                                    not be aligned to both boundaries to
                                    prevent an individual array element from
                                    crossing a boundary.

                                    If the size of a huge array causes it to
                                    cross two boundaries, the size of each
                                    array element must be a power of two, so
                                    that a whole number of elements will fit
                                    between two segment boundaries.

C2129                             static function 'function' not found

                                    A forward reference was made to a static

C2136                             'function' : prototype must have
                                    parameter types

                                    A function prototype declarator had
                                    formal-parameter names, but no types
                                    were provided for the parameters.

                                    A formal parameter in a function
                                    prototype must either have a type or be
                                    represented by an ellipsis (...) to
                                    indicate a variable number of arguments
                                    and no type checking.

                                    One cause of this error is a misspelling
                                    of a type name in a prototype that does
                                    not provide the names of formal
                                    parameters.

                                    before being used in an intrinsic pragma.
                                    This error appears only when compiling

C2194                             'segment' : is a text segment

                                    The given text segment was used where a
                                    data, const, or bss segment was expected.

C2195                             'segment' : is a data segment

                                    The given data segment was used where a

C2196                             /ML cannot be used with floating point

                                    The /ML option requires alternate math.
                                    QuickC does not support alternate math.
                                    The /ML option is allowed only when no
                                    floating-point code is used.

                                    block, but the function is not declared
                                    extern. This causes an error if the /Za
                                    option is in effect.

                                    For example, the following example code
                                    causes this error, when compiled  with
                                    /Za:

                                    without any members. This is an error
                                    only when compiling with /Za; otherwise,
                                    it is a warning.

C2209                             type cast in _based construct must be

                                    A _based pointer based on void cannot be
                                    dereferenced. Use the :> operator to
                                    create an address that can be
                                    dereferenced.

C2215                             :> operator only for objects based on

                                    The right operand of the :> operator
                                    must be a pointer based on void, as in

                                    Some combinations of attributes that
                                    cause this error are

                                    ■ _saveregs and _interrupt

                                    ■ _fastcall and _saveregs

                                    The first function attribute requires
                                    the second attribute to be used.

                                    Some causes for this error include

                                    ■ An interrupt function explicitly

                                    attribute from the function declaration.

C2218                             type in _based construct must be void

                                    The only type allowed within a _based

                                    compiler causes this error message to be
                                    displayed.

                                    Either correct the condition that caused
                                    the warning, or compile at a lower

                                    must be a struct/union type. It cannot
                                    be a pointer to a struct/union type.

                                    This error usually means that a '->'
                                    operator must be used.

                                    must be a pointer to a struct/union type.
                                    It cannot be a struct/union type.

                                    This error usually means that a '.'

                                    not a pointer to a struct/union type.

                                    This error can occur when the left
                                    operand is an undefined variable.

C4001                             nonstandard extension used - 'extension'

                                    The given nonstandard language extension
                                    was used when the /Ze option was
                                    specified.

                                    If the /Za option has been specified,
                                    this condition generates a syntax error.

C4007                             'identifier' : must be 'attribute'

                                    The attribute of the given function was
                                    not explicitly stated. The compiler
                                    forced the attribute.

                                    For example, the function main must have
                                    the _cdecl attribute.

C4008                             'identifier' : _fastcall attribute on

                                    The _fastcall attribute on the given
                                    data identifier was ignored.

C4023                             'function' : _based pointer passed to
                                    unprototyped function: parameter 'number
                                    '

                                    When in a near data model, only the
                                    offset portion of a _based pointer is
                                    passed to an unprototyped function. If
                                    the function expects a far pointer, the
                                    resulting code will be wrong. In any
                                    data model, if the function is defined
                                    to take a _based pointer with a
                                    different base, the resulting code may
                                    be unpredictable.

                                    If a prototype is used before the call,
                                    the call will be generated correctly.

C4050                             'operator' : different code attributes

                                    The function-pointer expressions used
                                    with operator had different code
                                    attributes. The attribute involved is
                                    either _export or_loadds.

                                    This is a warning and not an error,
                                    because _export and _loadds affect only
                                    entry sequences and not calling
                                    conventions.

C4054                             insufficient memory may affect
                                    optimization

                                    Not enough memory was available to do
                                    all requested optimizations. This
                                    message appears if available memory is
                                    within 64K of the absolute minimum that
                                    will accommodate the executable file.

C4056                             floating-point overflow

                                    The compiler generated a floating-point
                                    exception while doing constant
                                    arithmetic on floating-point items at
                                    compile time.

                                    For example:

                                    float fp_val = 1.0e100;

                                    In this example, the floating-point
                                    constant  1.0e100  exceeds the maximum
                                    allowable value for a double-precision
                                    data item.

C4059                             segment lost in conversion

                                    The conversion of a far pointer (a full
                                    segmented address) or _based pointer to
                                    a near pointer (a segment offset) or
                                    _based pointer resulted in the loss of
                                    the segment address.

C4063                             'function' : function too large for
                                    post-optimizer

                                    Not enough space was available to
                                    optimize the given function.

                                    One of the following may be a solution:

                                    ■ Recompile with fewer optimizations.

                                    ■ Divide the function into two or more
                                    smaller functions.

                                    be missed

                                    Some optimizations were skipped because
                                    not enough space was available for
                                    optimization.

                                    One of the following may be a solution:

                                    ■ Recompile with fewer optimizations.

                                    ■ Divide the function into two or more

C4066                             local symbol-table overflow - some local
                                    symbols may be missing in listings

                                    The listing generator ran out of heap
                                    space for local variables, so the source
                                    listing may not contain symbol-table
                                    information for all local variables.

                                    Extra characters followed a preprocessor
                                    directive and were ignored. This warning
                                    appears only when compiling with the /Za
                                    option.

                                    For example, the following code causes
                                    this warning:

                                    #endif    NO_EXT_KEYS

                                    To remove the warning, compile with /Ze
                                    or use comment delimiters:

                                    #endif    /* NO_EXT_KEYS */

C4072                             'function' : no function prototype on
                                    _fastcall function

                                    A _fastcall function was called without
                                    first being prototyped.

                                    Functions that are _fastcall should be
                                    prototyped to guarantee that the
                                    registers assigned at each point of call
                                    are the same as the registers assumed
                                    when the function is defined. A function
                                    defined in the new ANSI style is a
                                    prototype.

                                    A prototype must be added when this
                                    warning appears, unless the function
                                    takes no arguments or takes only
                                    arguments that cannot be passed in the
                                    general- purpose registers.

C4073                             scoping too deep, deepest scoping merged
                                    when debugging

                                    Declarations appeared at a static
                                    nesting level greater than 13. As a
                                    result, all de-clarations beyond this
                                    level will seem to appear at the same
                                    level.

C4078                             case constant 'value' too big for the
                                    type of switch expression

                                    A value appearing in a case statement
                                    was larger than the size of the type in
                                    the switch expression. The compiler
                                    converted the case value to the type of
                                    the switch expression.

                                    A problem can occur when two case
                                    constants have different values before
                                    being cast but the same value afterward.

C4080                             expected identifier for segment name,
                                    found 'token'

                                    The first argument in the argument list
                                    for the alloc_text pragma is missing a
                                    segment name. This happens if the first
                                    token in the argument list is not an
                                    identifier.

                                    The pragma was ignored.

C4081                             expected a comma, found 'token'

                                    A comma (,) was missing between two
                                    arguments of a pragma.

                                    The pragma was ignored.

C4096                             'attribute1' must be used with '
                                    attribute2'

                                    The use of attribute2 requires the use
                                    of attribute1.

                                    For example, using a variable number of
                                    arguments (...) requires that _cdecl be
                                    used. Also, _interrupt functions must be
                                    _far and _cdecl.

                                    The compiler assumed attribute1 for the
                                    function.

C4104                             'identifier' : near data in same_seg

                                    The given near variable was specified in
                                    a same_seg pragma.

                                    The identifier was ignored.

C4106                             pragma requires integer between 1 and
                                    127

                                    An integer constant in the range 1-127
                                    must be specified with the page and skip
                                    pragmas.

                                    The compiler assumed 1 was specified.

C4107                             pragma requires integer between 15 and
                                    255

                                    An integer constant in the range 15-255
                                    must be specified with the pagesize
                                    pragma.

                                    The compiler assumed 63 was specified.

C4108                             pragma requires integer between 79 and
                                    132

                                    An integer constant in the range 79-132
                                    must be specified with the linesize
                                    pragma.

                                    The compiler assumed 79 was specified.

C4119                             different bases 'name1' and 'name2'
                                    specified

                                    The _based pointers in the expression
                                    have different symbolic bases. There may
                                    be truncation or loss in the code
                                    generated.

C4120                             _based/unbased mismatch

                                    The expression contains a conversion
                                    between a _based pointer and another
                                    pointer that is unbased. Some
                                    information may have been truncated.

                                    This warning commonly occurs when a
                                    _based pointer is passed to a function
                                    that accepts a near or far pointer.

C4123                             different base expressions specified

                                    The expression contains a conversion
                                    between _based pointers, but the base
                                    expressions of the _based pointers are
                                    different. Some of the _based
                                    conversions may be unexpected.

C4124                             _fastcall with stack checking is
                                    inefficient

                                    The _fastcall keyword is used for
                                    generating fast code, but stack checking
                                    causes slower code to be generated.

                                    Use the /Gs option or the check_stack
                                    pragma to turn off stack checking when
                                    using _fastcall.

                                    This warning is informational and is
                                    issued only for the first function
                                    declared under these conditions.

C4125                             decimal digit terminates octal escape
                                    sequence

                                    An octal escape sequence in a character
                                    or string constant was terminated with a
                                    decimal digit.

                                    The compiler evaluated the octal number
                                    without the decimal digit, and assumed
                                    the decimal digit was a character.

                                    The following example causes this
                                    warning:

                                    char array1[] = "\\709";

                                    If the digit 9 was intended as a
                                    character and was not a typing error,
                                    correct the example as follows:

                                    char array[] = "\\0709";  /* String
                                    containing "89" */

C4126                             'flag' : unknown memory model flag

                                    The flag used with the /A option was not
                                    recognized and was ignored.

C4127                             conditional expression is constant

                                    The controlling expression of an if
                                    statement or while loop evaluates to a
                                    constant.

                                    As a result, the code in the body of the
                                    if statement or while loop is either
                                    always executed or never executed.

                                    This warning is informational.

C4128                             storage-class specifier after type

                                    A storage-class specifier (auto, extern,
                                    register, static) appears after a type
                                    in a declaration. The compiler assumed
                                    the storage class specifier occurred
                                    before the type.

                                    New-style code places the storage-class
                                    specifier first.

C4129                             'character' : unrecognized character
                                    escape sequence

                                    The character following a backslash in a
                                    character or string constant was not
                                    recognized as a valid escape sequence.

                                    As a result, the backslash is ignored
                                    and not printed, and the character
                                    following the backslash is printed.

                                    To print a single backslash ( \ ),
                                    specify a double backslash ( \\ ).

C4130                             'operator' : logical operation on
                                    address of string constant

                                    The operator was used with the address
                                    of a string literal. Unexpected code was
                                    generated.

                                    For example, the following code causes
                                    this warning:

                                    char *pc;
                                    pc = "Hello";
                                    if (pc == "Hello") ...

                                    The if statement compares the value
                                    stored in the pointer pc to the address
                                    of the string  "Hello", which is
                                    separately allocated each time it occurs
                                    in the code. It does not compare the
                                    string pointed to by pc with the string
                                    "Hello".

                                    To compare strings, use the strcmp
                                    function.

C4131                             'function' : uses old-style declarator

                                    The function declaration or definition
                                    is not a prototype.

                                    New-style function declarations are in
                                    prototype form.

C4132                             'object' : const object should be
                                    initialized

                                    The value of a const object cannot be
                                    changed, so the only way to give the
                                    const object a value is to initialize it.

                                    It will not be possible to assign a
                                    value to object.

C4135                             conversion between different integral
                                    types

                                    Information was lost between two
                                    integral types.

                                    For example, the following code causes
                                    this warning:

                                    int intvar;
                                    long longvar;
                                    intvar = longvar;

                                    If the information is merely interpreted
                                    differently, this warning is not given,
                                    as in the following example:

                                    unsigned uintvar = intvar;

C4136                             conversion between different floating
                                    types

                                    Information was lost or truncated
                                    between two floating types.

                                    For example, the following code causes
                                    this warning:

                                    double doublevar;
                                    float floatvar;
                                    floatvar = doublevar;

                                    Note that unsuffixed floating-point
                                    constants have type double, so the
                                    following code causes this warning:

                                    floatvar = 1.0;

                                    If the floating-point constant should be
                                    treated as float type, use the F (or f)
                                    suffix on the constant to prevent the
                                    following warning:

                                    floatvar = 1.0F;

C4137                             'function' : no return value from
                                    floating-point function

                                    The given function had no return
                                    statement.

                                    A long double function returns its value
                                    on the floating-point stack or the
                                    emulated stack. If the function does not
                                    return a value, a run-time
                                    floating-point stack underflow may occur.

C4138                             '*/' found outside of comment

                                    The compiler found a closing comment
                                    delimiter (*/) without a preceding
                                    opening delimiter. It assumed a space
                                    between the asterisk (*) and the forward
                                    slash ( / ).

                                    The following example causes this
                                    warning:

                                    int */*comment*/ptr;

                                    In this example, the compiler assumed a
                                    space before the first comment delimiter
                                    ( /* ), and issued the warning but
                                    compiled the line normally. To remove
                                    the warning, insert the assumed space.

                                    Usually, the cause of this warning is an
                                    attempt to nest comments.

                                    To comment out sections of code that may
                                    contain comments, enclose the code in an
                                    #if/#endif block and set the controlling
                                    expression to zero, as in:

                                    #if 0
                                    int my_variable;   /* Declaration
                                    currently not needed */
                                    #endif

C4139                             'hexnumber' : hex escape sequence is out
                                    of range

                                    A hex escape sequence appearing in a
                                    character or string constant was too
                                    large to be converted to a character.

                                    If in a string constant, the compiler
                                    cast the low byte of the hexadecimal
                                    number to a char. If in a char constant,
                                    the compiler made the cast and then sign
                                    extended the result. If in a char
                                    constant and compiled with /J, the
                                    compiler cast the value to an unsigned
                                    char.

                                    For example, ' \\ x1ff ' is out of range
                                    for a character. Note that the following
                                    code causes this warning:

                                    printf("\\x7Bell\\n");

                                    The number  7be  is a legal hex number,
                                    but is too large for a character. To
                                    correct this example, use three hex
                                    digits:

                                    printf("\\x007Bell\\n");

C4140                             'function' redefined : preceding

                                    The compiler issues this warning if a
                                    function definition changes between
                                    incremental compilations.

                                    References previous to the redefinition
                                    use the previous definition. Subsequent
                                    references use the new definition.

                                    For example:

                                    main()
                                    {
                                    func1 ();
                                    }
                                    int func1 ()
                                    { }

                                    If this program is compiled with the /Gi
                                    option, and later the  func1  definition
                                    is changed to  long func1, the compiler
                                    issues this message to warn that calls
                                    to  func1  may be of the wrong type.

                                    Be sure that function calls reference
                                    the correct type; if not, recompile
                                    without /Gi. To avoid the problem
                                    altogether, use function prototypes.

                                    segment

                                    The given function was specified in an
                                    alloc_text pragma without being declared
                                    with _far, and then was called from text
                                    segment.

                                    The compiler generated a near call.

                                    Although this is a warning message
                                    rather than an error message, the
                                    resulting code will not work correctly.

                                    allow-able length and was truncated.

                                    that had not been assigned a value. As a
                                    result, the value of the variable is
                                    unpredictable.

                                    This warning is given only when

                                    A reference was made to a local variable
                                    that might not have been assigned a
                                    value. As a result, the value of the
                                    variable may be unpredictable.

                                    This warning is given only when

                                    optimizations (/Oe, /Og, or /Ol).

C4203                             'function' : function too large for
                                    global optimizations

                                    The named function was too large to fit
                                    in memory and be compiled with the
                                    selected optimization. The compiler did
                                    not perform any global optimiza- tions
                                    (/Oe, /Og, or /Ol). Other /O
                                    optimizations, such as /Oa and /Oi, are
                                    still performed.

                                    One of the following may remove this
                                    warning:

                                    ■ Recompile with fewer optimizations.

                                    ■ Divide the function into two or more
                                    smaller functions.

C4204                             'function' : in-line assembler precludes
                                    global optimizations

                                    The use of in-line assembler in the
                                    named function prevented the specified
                                    global optimizations (/Oe, /Og, or /Ol)
                                    from being performed.

C4205                             statement has no effect

                                    The indicated statement will have no
                                    effect on the program execution.

                                    The following are examples of statements
                                    with no effect:

                                    1;
                                    a + 1
                                    ; b == c;

C4206                             assignment within conditional expression

                                    The test value in a conditional
                                    expression was the result of an
                                    assignment.

                                    This warning is informational.

                                    An assignment has a value (the value at
                                    the left side of the assignment) that
                                    can be used legally in another
                                    expression, including a test expression.
                                    However, the intention may have been to
                                    test a relation instead of an assignment.

                                    For example, the following line, which
                                    causes this warning, assigns  b  to  a
                                    and compares the value of  a  with 0:

                                    if (a = b) ...

                                    However, the following line tests
                                    whether  a  and  b  are equal:

                                    if (a == b) ...

C4209                             comma operator within array index
                                    expression

                                    The value used as an index into an array
                                    was the last one of multiple expressions
                                    separated by the comma operator.

                                    It is legal for an array index to be the
                                    value of the last expression in a series
                                    of expressions separated by the comma
                                    operator. However, the intent may have
                                    been to use the expressions to specify
                                    multiple indexes into a multidimensional
                                    array.

                                    For example, the following line, which
                                    causes this warning, is legal in C, and
                                    specifies the index  c  into array  a:

                                    a[b,c]

                                    However, the following line uses both  b
                                    and  c  as indexes into a two-
                                    dimensional array:

                                    a[b][c]

C4300                             insufficient memory to process debugging
                                    information

                                    The program was compiled with the /Zi
                                    option, but not enough memory was
                                    available to create the required
                                    debugging information.

                                    One of the following may be a solution:

                                    ■ Split the current file into two or
                                    more files and compile them separately.

                                    ■ Remove other programs or drivers
                                    running in the system which could be
                                    consuming significant amounts of memory.

C4301                             loss of debugging information caused by
                                    optimization

                                    Some optimizations, such as code motion,
                                    cause references to nested variables to
                                    be moved. The information about the
                                    level at which the variables are
                                    declared may be lost. As a result, all
                                    declarations will seem to be at nesting
                                    level 1.

C4323                             potential divide by 0

                                    The second operand in a divide operation
                                    evaluated to zero at compile time,
                                    giving undefined results.

                                    The 0 operand may have been generated by
                                    the compiler, as in the following
                                    example:

                                    func1() { int i,j,k; i /= j && k; }

C4324                             potential mod by 0

                                    The second operand in a remainder
                                    operation evaluated to zero at compile
                                    time, giving undefined results.

C4414                             'function' : short jump to function
                                    converted to near

                                    Short jumps generate a one-byte
                                    instruction. The instruction includes a
                                    short offset that represents the
                                    distance between the jump and the
                                    function definition. The compiler must
                                    generate a special record for the jump,
                                    which requires the jump to be either
                                    NEAR or FAR, but not SHORT. The compiler
                                    made the conversion.

                                    For example, the following code causes
                                    this warning:

                                    main()
                                    {
                                        _asm jmp SHORT main
                                    }


5.2  Command-Line Error Messages

Messages that indicate errors on the command line used to invoke the
compiler have one of the following formats:

    command line error D2xxx: messagetext  Error
    command line warning D4xxx: messagetext  Warning

The compiler issues a warning message and, if possible, continues
processing. In some cases, command-line errors are fatal and the compiler
terminates processing.

When the QCL compiler encounters any of the errors listed in this section,
it terminates, producing no object file.

                                    option requires three letters in the
                                    string. The letters specify the

                                    and data-segment setup attributes of the

                                    interpreted to be part of a customized
                                    memory-model specification. For example:

                                    qcl /As

    A single lowercase letter can be used only if it is a segment setup
    option and is used in combination with a standard memory model.

5.3  Run-Time Error Message

The following message may be generated at run time.

A run-time error message takes the following general form:

run-time error R6nnn- messagetext

Number                            Run-Time Error Message
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
R6010                             abnormal program termination

                                    This error is displayed by the abort( )
                                    routine. The program terminates with
                                    exit code 3, unless an abort( ) signal
                                    handler has been defined by using the
                                    signal( ) function.


5.4  QLINK Error Messages

This section lists error messages generated by the QuickC linker (QLINK) and
the special incremental linker (ILINK) that is invoked when you compile
QuickC programs with the /Gi or /Li option. Note that in most cases, QuickC
will invoke QLINK if ILINK fails.

Fatal errors, which cause the linker to stop execution, have the following
format:

    location  : error L1  xxx  :  messagetext

Nonfatal errors, which indicate problems in the executable file, do not
cause QLINK to stop execution; QLINK produces the executable file. Nonfatal
error messages have the following format:

    location  : error L2  xxx  :  messagetext

Warnings indicate possible problems in the executable file. QLINK produces
the executable file. Warnings have the following format:

    location  : warning L4  xxx  :  messagetext

In all three kinds of messages, location is the input file associated with
the error, or  QLINK  if there is no input file. If the input file is an
.OBJ or .LIB file and a module name is associated with the error, the module
name is enclosed in paren-theses, as shown in the following examples:

    SLIBC.LIB(_file)
    MAIN.OBJ(main.c)
    TEXT.OBJ

5.4.3  Warning Messages

The following warning messages may appear when you link object files:

Number                            Warning Message
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
L4004                             possible fixup overflow at 'offset' in
                                    segment 'segment'

                                    A near call/jump was made to another
                                    segment which was not a member of the
                                    same group as the segment from which the
                                    call/jump was made.

                                    This call/jump can cause an incorrect
                                    address calculation when the distance
                                    between the paragraph address (frame
                                    number) of the segment group and the
                                    target segment is greater than 64K, even
                                    when the distance between the segment
                                    where the call/jump was actually made
                                    and the target segment is less than 64K.

L4017                             'option' : unrecognized option name;
                                    option ignored

                                    An unrecognized character followed the
                                    option indicator (/).

                                    An example of this warning is

                                    QLINK /ABCDEF main;

L4019                             /TINY disables /INCREMENTAL

                                    A .COM file always requires a full link
                                    and cannot be incrementally linked.

                                    The /TINY and /INCREMENTAL options are
                                    incompatible. When they are used
                                    together, the linker ignores
                                    /INCREMENTAL.

L4023                             'routine' ('internalname') : export

                                    The internal name of the given exported
                                    routine conflicted with the internal
                                    name of a previous import definition or
                                    export definition.

L4024                             'name' : multiple definitions for export
                                    name

                                    The given name was exported more than
                                    once, an action that is not allowed.

L4025                             'modulename'.'importname'('internalname')
                                    : import internal name conflict

                                    The internal name of the given imported
                                    routine (import is either a name or a
                                    number) conflicted with the internal
                                    name of a previous export or import.

L4026                             'modulename'.'importname'('internalname')

                                    The given imported routine was imported
                                    from the module being linked. This is
                                    not supported on some systems.

L4027                             'name' : multiple definitions for import
                                    internal name

                                    The given internal name was imported
                                    more than once. Previous import
                                    definitions are ignored.

L4028                             'segment' : segment already defined

                                    The given segment was defined more than
                                    once in the SEGMENTS statement of the
                                    module-definition file.

L4030                             'segment' : segment attributes changed
                                    to conform with automatic data segment

                                    The given logical segment in the group
                                    DGROUP was given sharing attributes
                                    (SHARED/NONSHARED) that differed from
                                    the automatic data attributes as
                                    declared by the DATA instance
                                    specification (SINGLE/MULTIPLE). The
                                    attri-butes are converted to conform to
                                    those of DGROUP.

                                    The name DGROUP is predefined as the
                                    automatic data segment. DGROUP cannot
                                    contain code segments because the linker
                                    always considers DGROUP to be a data
                                    segment.

L4040                             stack size ignored for /TINY

                                    The linker ignores stack size if /TINY
                                    is given and if the stack segment has
                                    been defined in front of the code
                                    segment.

L4042                             cannot open old version

                                    The file specified in the OLD statement
                                    in the module-definition file could not
                                    be opened.

L4045                             name of output file is 'filename'

                                    The linker had to change the name of the
                                    output file to the given file name.

                                    If the output file is specified without
                                    an extension, the linker assumes the
                                    default extension .EXE. Creating a Quick
                                    library, .DLL file, or .COM file forces
                                    the linker to use an extension other
                                    than .EXE:

Output File Specification         Extension
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
/TINY option                      .COM

/QUICKLIB option                  .QLB

                                    /CODEVIEW

                                    When debugging with CodeView, if there
                                    are multiple code segments defined in
                                    one module (.OBJ file) by use of the
                                    compiler #pragma alloc_text() and the
                                    program is built as an overlaid program,
                                    you can access the symbolic information
                                    for only the first code segment in
                                    overlay. Symbolic information for the
                                    rest of the code segments in overlay is
                                    not accessible.


5.5  NMAKE Error Messages

Error messages from the NMAKE utility have one of the following formats:

    {filename |  NMAKE} :  fatal error U1  xxx: messagetext
    {filename |  NMAKE} :  warning U4  xxx: messagetext

The message begins with the input-file name (filename) and line number, if
one exists, or with the name of the utility.


5.5.1  Fatal-Error Messages

NMAKE generates the following error messages:

                                    The file cannot be read.

                                    The following are possible causes of
                                    this error:

                                    ■ The file does not have appropriate

                                    NMAKE failed in its attempt to create
                                    the file given by name.

                                    The following are possible causes of
                                    this error:

                                    The environment space limit was reached.

                                    Restart the program with a larger
                                    environment space or with fewer

                                    The command processor was not found.

                                    NMAKE uses COMMAND.COM or CMD.EXE as a
                                    command processor to execute commands.
                                    It looks for the command processor first
                                    by the full path name given by the
                                    COMSPEC environment variable. If COMSPEC
                                    does not exist, NMAKE searches the
                                    directories specified by the PATH
                                    environment variable.

U1057                             cannot delete temporary file 'filename'

                                    NMAKE failed to delete the temporary
                                    in-line file.

U1058                             terminated by user

                                    name of the description file to be
                                    specified.

                                    To use standard input, specify '-' as
                                    the description file name.

U1062                             missing file name with /X option

                                    The /X command-line option requires the
                                    name of the file to which diagnostic
                                    error output should be redirected.

                                    To use standard input, specify '-' as
                                    the output file name.

U1063                             missing macro name before '='

                                    NMAKE detected an equal sign (=) without
                                    a preceding name.

                                    This error can occur in a recursive call
                                    when the macro corresponding to the
                                    macro name expands to nothing.

U1064                             MAKEFILE not found and no target
                                    specified

                                    No description file was found, and no
                                    target was specified.

                                    A description file can be specified
                                    either with the /F option or through the
                                    default file MAKEFILE. Note that NMAKE
                                    can create a target using an inference
                                    rule even if no description file is
                                    specified.

U1065                             invalid option 'option'

                                    The option specified is not a valid
                                    option for NMAKE.

U1066                             option '/N' not supported; use NMAKE

                                    NMAKE's shell program NMK.COM does not
                                    support the /N option.

                                    Use NMAKE /N.

U1083                             target macro '$(macroname)' expands to
                                    nothing

                                    A target was specified as a macro name
                                    that has not been defined or has null
                                    value.

                                    NMAKE cannot process a null target.

U1084                             in-line file not allowed in inference
                                    rules

                                    In-line file syntax is not allowed in
                                    inference rules and can be used only in
                                    a target-dependency block.

U1094                             syntax error : only (no)keep allowed
                                    here

                                    Something other than KEEP or NOKEEP
                                    appeared at the end of the syntax for
                                    creating an in-line file.

                                    The syntax for generating an in-line
                                    file allows an action to be specified
                                    after the second pair of angle brackets.
                                    Valid actions are KEEP and NOKEEP. Other
                                    actions are errors.

                                    The KEEP option specifies that NMAKE
                                    should leave the in-line file on disk.
                                    The NOKEEP option causes NMAKE to delete
                                    the file before exiting. The default is
                                    NOKEEP.

U1095                             expanded command line 'commandline' too
                                    long

                                    After macro expansion, the command line
                                    shown exceeded the length limit for
                                    command lines for the operating system.

                                    DOS permits up to 128 characters on a
                                    command line.

                                    If the command is a QLINK command line,
                                    use a response file.

U1096                             cannot open file 'filename'

                                    The given file could not be opened,
                                    either because the disk was full or
                                    because the file has been set to be
                                    read-only.

U1097                             extmake syntax usage error, no dependent

                                    No dependent was given.

                                    In extmake syntax, the target under
                                    consideration must have either an
                                    implicit dependent or an explicit
                                    dependent.

U1098                             extmake syntax in 'string' incorrect

                                    The part of the string shown contains an
                                    extmake syntax error.


5.5.2  Compilation-Error Message

NMAKE generates the following compilation-error messages:

Number                            Compilation-Error Message
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
U2001                             no more file handles (too many files
                                    open)

                                    NMAKE could not find a free file handle.

                                    One of the following may be a solution:

                                    ■ Reduce recursion in the build
                                    procedures.

                                    ■ Increase the number of file handles by
                                    changing the FILES setting in
                                    CONFIG.SYS to allow a larger number of
                                    open files. FILES =20 is the recommended
                                    setting.


5.5.3  Warning Messages

NMAKE generates the following warning messages:

Number                            Warning Message
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
U4001                             command file can be invoked only from
                                    command line

                                    A command file cannot be invoked from
                                    within another command file. Such an
                                    invocation is ignored.

                                    The command file should contain the
                                    entire remaining command line.

U4002                             resetting value of special macro '
                                    macroname'

                                    The value of a macro such as $(MAKE) was
                                    changed within a description file.

                                    The name by which this program was
                                    invoked is not a tagged section in the
                                    TOOLS.INI file.

U4003                             no match found for wild card 'filename'

                                    There are no file names that match the
                                    specified target or dependent file with
                                    the wild-card characters asterisk (*)
                                    and question mark (?).

U4004                             too many rules for target 'targetname'

                                    Multiple blocks of build commands were
                                    specified for a target using single
                                    colons (:) as separators.

U4005                             ignoring rule 'rule' (extension not in
                                    .SUFFIXES)

                                    The rule was ignored because the
                                    suffix(es) in the rule are not listed in
                                    the .SUFFIXES list.

U4006                             special macro undefined : 'macroname'

                                    The special macro name is undefined and
                                    expands to nothing.

U4007                             file name 'filename' too long;
                                    truncating to 8.3

                                    The base name of the file has more than
                                    eight characters, or the extension has
                                    more than three characters. NMAKE
                                    truncates the name to an eight-character
                                    base and a three-character extension.

U4008                             removed target 'target'

                                    Execution of NMAKE was interrupted while
                                    NMAKE was trying to build the given
                                    target, and therefore the target was
                                    incomplete. Because the target was not
                                    specified in the .PRECIOUS list, NMAKE
                                    has deleted it.

U4009                             duplicate in-line file 'filename'

                                    The given file name is the same as the
                                    name of an earlier in-line file.

                                    Reuse of this name caused the earlier
                                    file to be overwritten. This will
                                    probably cause unexpected results.
