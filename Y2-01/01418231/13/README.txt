Although the instruction allows both C and C++ program to be submitted.
But files ending with .cpp might be interpreted by the compiler as C++ source file.
Since syntax of C and C++ are not exactly the same, C++ compilers might produce errors if supplying C source file or vice versa.
As a result, I have submitted both .c and .cpp and also a pdf document for graph representation of the maze itself.

I have not done constructing the program due to programming logical errors
but have got the idea to solve the problem with BFS as represented in the pdf document.
