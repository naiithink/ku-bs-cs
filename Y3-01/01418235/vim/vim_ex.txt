In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,

Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.

The rabbit went straight on a tunnel for some way, and 
then dipped suddenly down, so that Alice had not a moment 
to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling 
down very deep.

Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she 
had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to 
wonder what was going to happen next. First, she tried to look down 
and make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see 
anything; then she looked at the sides of the well, and noticed 
that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves; here and 
there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs. She took down a 
jar from one of the shelves as she passed; it was labelled 
but to her great disappointment it was empty: 
she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody, 
so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it.

The Owl and the Pussycat went to sea
In a beautiful pea-green boat,
They took some honey, and plenty of money,
Wrapped up in a five pound note.

And sang to a small guitar,
"O lovely Pussy! O Pussy, my love,
What a beautiful Pussy you are, you are, you are,
What a beautiful Pussy you are."
Pussy said to the Owl "You elegant fowl, 
How charmingly sweet you sing.
O let us be married, too long we have tarried;
But what shall we do for a ring?"

one command (e.g. 3e or 2w).

e stands for the end of the word.

                        a      b
w means word, that is, move to the next word.

                        a          b        c           d
punctation counts as a word, so this comma, and this one, count.

c                    a             b
use 0 to jump to the first character of the line.

Went to the cupboard
To get her poor doggie a bone,

And doesn't know where to find them.

Bringing their tails behind them.

fell fast asleep
And dreamt she heard them bleating,

Beside the lake, beneath the trees,
Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.
