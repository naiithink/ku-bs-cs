Four score and six years ago, our father
bought forth on this continent a new
country, conceived on liberty and
dedicated in to the idea that all man
are created equal. Now we are engaged in
a great war. We have had come to
dedicate a portion of that as a final
resting place for those who here gave
their lives that nation might live.
