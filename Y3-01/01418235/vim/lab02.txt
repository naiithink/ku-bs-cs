	1.2 My thoughts on vim
		To be honest, I am an Emacs user. vim used to be the CLI text editor
		of my choice, just before I met Emacs.

		vim control keys are not intuitively recognizeable.
		Such as the cursor control keys. In the resting position,
		we -- at least to me -- rest our left and right hands by placing
		the index fingers on F and J keys, respectively. But in order
		to move the cursor while using vim, we need to shift our right
		hand fingers to the left to make them agree with vim's hjkl key layout.

		Modes made me confused.
		Switching between normal and insert -- or otherlike -- modes is such a pain for me.
		With Emacs, we can insert text and move the cursor without having to switch
		between modes -- and I am glad that I can move cursor up or down by pressing ^n or ^p
		which I am more comfortable to.

		vim is light-weight (likely).
		When it comes to performance, vim does not take up as much memory as Emacs.
		This might be the only reason if I had to switch from Emacs to vim.
