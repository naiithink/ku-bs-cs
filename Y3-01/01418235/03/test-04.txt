Four score and seven years ago_our fathers
brought forth on this continent a new
country, conceived in liberty, and dedicated
to the idea that all men are created
equal. Now we are ENGAGED in a great
war, testing whether our nation, or any
nation so conceived and so dedicated
can last. We are met on a GREAT_BATTLEFIELD
of that war. We have come
to dedicate a portion of that filed as
a final resting-place for those who here
gave their lives that that nation might
live.
