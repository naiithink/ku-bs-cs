Linux and unix
Linux is modeled on Unix, but developed independently, 
and is free, open sourced software. Unix, in its many 
flavors is propriatery, although I think Sun might have 
open sourced their version of Unix, 
but I could be very wrong.

UNX
Linux/Unix are very powerful, multi-user capable systems, 
and can be run either from command line or through GUIs. 
I am not sure what limitations Unix has in terms of using 
the numerous GUIs that run on Linux.

UNIX
I think Unix is more hardware demanding than Linux, 
but I could be wrong.
File systems on unix and Linux are similar. File information
is kept inside an inode.

DOS
DOS is a command line OS, single user, much less 
powerful than Linux or Unix. Many commands for DOS were 
also present in (and copied from?) CP/M. 
Many Linux/UNIX commands are different from those of DOS.
